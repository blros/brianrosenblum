Abstract: This paper first describes IDRH’s programs and the role of the Stakeholders and co-directors in the partnership, and discusses some of the benefits and challenges of this collaborative model of support and leadership. We then discuss some of the specific ways in which IDRH has tried to build partnership on campus and establish relationships between faculty and the libraries, including the formation of an advisory board, and providing multiple opportunities for faculty to get involved in review committees or as instructors in workshops. This chapter also serves as a critical review of IDRH’s first four years, from the founding of the Institute in fall 2010 to fall 2014, when this chapter was written.

MLA Session: Developing and Sustaining Collaborative Research in the Humanities
26 Jul 2015

Panelists share examples of four collaborative projects involving research by a team of two or more scholars from literary studies and computer science or other disciplines. Discussion focuses on best practices, lessons learned, communication strategies, what challenges to anticipate, and methods, tools, and outcomes.

Friday, January 8 at 5:15–6:30 p.m.

Presiding: Brian Rosenblum, Univ. of Kansas Libraries

Speakers:
Sayan Bhattacharyya, Univ. of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign
Katharine Coles, University of Utah
Patricia Fumerton, University of California, Santa Barbara
Lauren Klein, Georgia Institute of Technology
Miriah Meyer, University of Utah
Muhammad Saad Shamin, Baylor College of Medicine
Carl Stahmer, University of California, Davis

The four projects, all NEH-funded collaborations, are described briefly below:

    TOME: Short for Interactive TOpic Model and MEtadata Visualization, TOME is a tool designed to support the exploratory thematic analysis of digitized archival collections. Collaboratively authored by a computer scientist and a literary scholar, it generates visualizations designed to allow scholars to trace the evolution and circulation of themes across social networks and over time. Resting on an archive of nineteenth-century abolitionist newspapers, the PIs are able to employ their tool to ask questions about authorship, influence, and audience. The PI’s collaboratively conceived of the computational technique of topic modeling as a process of thematic exploration. Their work was motivated by the implications of their successes and failures for the fields of both nineteenth-century scholarship and text visualization. (Panelist: Laren Klein.)

    Poemage: A collaboration between poets, literary scholars and computer scientists specializing in visualization and simulation, the Poemage project aims to develop a tool to visualize the “poem space” of a poem—not only the shape of the poem on the page and its internal actions and relationships, but also how the poem sounds, as well as its engagements with the reader. The collaborative process forced the project teams to rethink how they understood poetry, determine what data was valuable to each group, consider how to balance long-term and short-term goals, and imagine how the project might generate new insights in both literary studies and computer science. (Panelists: Katharine Coles & Miriah Meyer.)

    EBBA: The English Broadside Ballad Archive brings together a team of experts in the fields of English literature, digital programming, and ethnographic music, to make broadside ballads of the seventeenth century fully accessible as texts, art, music, and cultural records. The project is intensely collaborative, and advances through a process of constantly meeting, arguing, and group thinking. Team leaders from every key aspect of the project meet weekly to address problems as a team—where everyone is confident that they can speak freely and that their ideas will be heard and often implemented, even at the cost of redoing aspects of the project—and the team leaders mentor or apprentice students and those newer to the project in an ongoing regenerative chain-of-being (working both up and down) of collaborative expertise. (Panelists: Patricia Fumerton and Carl G. Stahmer.)

    HathiTrust+Bookworm: The HT+BW project is a large-scale, multi-disciplinary, multi-institutional endeavor involving collaborators from the fields of literature, librarianship, education, culturomics, computer science, and applied mathematics. It combines an interest in humanistic research based on texts and their interpretation with the possibility of scientific and statistical analyses of corpora. This presentation will discuss the dynamics of this collaboration, including the emphasis on finding shared values to move the collaboration forward. (Panelists: Sayan Bhattacharyya and Muhammad Saad Shamim.)

Brian Rosenblum, Frances Devlin, Tami Albin, and Wade Garrison. “Collaboration and Co¬Teaching: Librarians Teaching Digital Humanities in the Classroom” in Digital Humanities in the Library: Challenges and Opportunities for Subject Specialists, Edited by Arianne Hartsell-Gundy, Laura Braunstein, and Liorah Golomb (Association of College & Research Libraries, 2015): https://www.alastore.ala.org/detail.aspx?ID=11391.

Abstract: Digital Humanities (DH) as an area of engagement with students, staff, and teaching faculty has been rapidly evolving at the University of Kansas Libraries (KU Libraries) over the past several years. As the popularity of DH tools, platforms and methodologies has increased, so has the demand to support and engage teaching faculty with incorporating DH in their courses and with their own research interests. Many academic libraries, including KU Libraries, are both adjusting to and leading this shift, figuring out ways to support digital scholarship for research and teaching, while at the same time gently delineating our roles, responsibilities, and limitations.

This chapter will describe three examples of efforts by librarians with subject, instruction, and digital scholarship expertise to provide digital humanities instruction and training to students and faculty, and will look at how these efforts relate to our previous and evolving roles within the library. We will also provide concrete examples of in-class assignments, describe what worked well and what could be improved, and discuss some possible ways that we ourselves might develop the knowledge and skills needed to engage in this kind of work. We hope that these examples and observations can serve as models, starting-points, or inspiration for subject specialists to both learn more about digital humanities and to develop their own course activities.

Book Club Notes: Bethany Nowviskie’s 'Skunk in the Library'
20 Apr 2015
A new book club

Last week a few of us here at KU Libraries held the first session of our new DH and Libraries “book club” or reading group. Our aim is to meet every couple of weeks during a Friday lunch hour to informally discuss an article or other reading related to digital humanities and libraries. The group was formed in part to take advantage of Casey Hoeve’s presence at KU. Casey is the content development librarian for arts, architecture, and the humanities at Kansas State University, and has been awarded a Big XII faculty fellowship to spend time at KU Libraries exploring the connection between digital humanities and libraries. He will be spending Fridays with us at KU for the next 2-3 months.

The discussion was not only lively, fun and educational, but nutritious as well, thanks to the delicious carrot/walnut cupcakes provided by Pam Lach, and it provided a refreshing opportunity to simply meet and discuss a professional topic with no agenda in mind. Here are some brief notes from our discussion.
A Skunk in the Library

For our first session, we tackled Bethany Nowviskie’s 2011 piece, “A Skunk in the Library: the Path to Production for Scholarly R&D”, on Scholars Lab as a skunkworks R&D unit within the University of Virginia Library. Nowviskie (who, coincidentally, began her first day as Director of the Digital Library Federation on the day before our discussion) describes the organizational challenges and potential benefits of creating a protected space for R&D within a service-oriented organization, a space where “a small and nimble technical team [are] deliberately and self-consciously and (yes) quite unfairly freed from much of the surrounding bureaucracy of the larger organization in which it finds itself.” Scholars Lab faculty and staff, under Nowviskie, were granted 20% of their time to pursue self-directed or collaborative research. This research time resulted in some notable accomplishments, such as the development of Project Blacklight, Neatline, and the UVA Library Geoportal.
Discussion

Élika Ortega launched our discussion by noting that she had a different perspective reading this now that she is based in a library, compared to reading it earlier as a graduate student. She noted that Scholars Lab has been a great success, but asked if this is the only model for innovative digital work within the library and the model that we should be aiming to follow, and asked us to chime in with how we all reacted to the article, as we all brought different types of library expertise and skills (including metadata, special collections, and instruction).

Below are a few questions and topics from the lively conversation that followed.

    Nowviskie discusses Blacklight and some other notable success stories that demonstrate the potential value of a skunkworks. Were there other projects that were not as successful or did not find a viable path to production?

    Are there issues of gender equity in pursuing this kind of R&D model in which developers, who are overwhelmingly male, receive special protected research time? Nowviskie hints at this briefly, but does not explore it further in this piece: > “How easily do you imagine skunks are tolerated within an overall library culture that values consensus and teamwork, rightly wants to see innovation blooming everywhere, seems to be moving (if fitfully) toward erasure of privileged status within its own ranks, and which retains a certain lovely – and, (let’s admit it) often gendered – self-conception of its members as the handmaidens of scholarship, people with a calling – with a vocation to serve?”

    What are some other examples of skunkworks/R&D labs in research libraries, perhaps of smaller scale? NYPL Labs and British Library Labs come to mind. What about other academic libraries?
    How could a library such as ours do this without external funding, in an under-resourced environment, where we don’t have a “rag-tag crew” of under-utilized developers lying around, and where our only technical group is charged with supporting mission-critical systems?
        Can we piggy-back on tools developed by others? We don’t have to duplicate the efforts of other institutions, but could use the tools they develop to launch our own initiatives.
        Can there be a non-technical skunkworks that is not about technical development but about other library functions and practices, such as models of instruction, partnering with faculty researchers, or innovative digital publishing efforts? What would that look like?
        Can we find expertise and skills outside the library, such as computer science students, to participate in code sprints and technical development?

    How is R&D work affected by librarian job classifications and promotion & tenure requirements? Can you do R&D without a research component to your job? How would P&T committees, both within and outside the library, view research time devoted to (for example) collaboratively building a software tool. If our professional work is described entirely in terms of service and professional responsibilities how can we pursue R&D work?
    Is it feasible for individuals with allocated research time to pool that time together to create an unofficial skunkworks, and what are the risks of doing so?

A few other points

Nowviskie’s article touched on numerous other points. Here are a couple which particularly resonated with me.

    The importance of challenging the notion of service in librarianship and the idea that libraries have an “obligation” to digital humanities. This obligation is about both (1) “modeling the digital humanities being done right” for traditional faculty and grad students, for DH scholars, and for alt-ac professionals, and (2) creating “a research agenda of our own collective making.” If we are defined entirely in terms of a service role, how can we ensure that our profession continues to evolve, adapt to, anticipate, and shape changes in the scholarly communications ecosystem.
    Communication challenges and the need for “a constant internal and external PR campaign.”
        how do we make the case to administration; how do we talk about what we do to a library audience;
        the tendency of libraries to “hide the messy innards of the library from your faculty, the very people who would be your strongest allies if the building weren’t a black box.”
        “the incalculable value of those hallway conversations with scholars and digital humanities project staff.” Keep those channels of communication open with faculty projects outside the library.
    Organizational changes and challenges
        the increasing presence of more #alt-ac employees within libraries
        anxiety among librarians with changing roles
        the need for “either balancing or obliterating the distinctions” between public services and production & technology services.
        the need to balance a research agenda “that is recognizable as scholarly to fellow scholars” and that is integrated into the larger functions of the library.
        the need to balance being on the the cutting edge and devoting resources to maintaining current functions and making collections accesible. Ideally these complement each other.

I really enjoyed the discussion and am looking forward to doing it again in two weeks.

MLA 2016 CFP: Developing and Sustaining Collaborative Research in the Humanities
27 Feb 2015

How can humanities scholars establish partnerships and develop collaborative, cross-disciplinary research projects capable of attracting external funding?

This panel will provide an opportunity to share examples and discuss collaborative research in the humanities. We seek proposals that illustrate best practices, model projects, lessons learned, methods, tools, or outcomes related to projects that involve interpretive humanities research undertaken by a team of two or more scholars.

Proposals submitted by teams of two or more researchers are preferred.
What is collaborative research?

Collaborative research is more than cooperation, sharing of data, hiring of consultants or technology help, or even dialogue among researchers. For the purposes of this panel, collaborative research is the joint conceptualization, execution and/or dissemination of research by two or more scholars, preferably in different disciplines or sub-disciplines. Extending beyond the traditional lone-scholar model of humanities research, collaborative research involves at least two fully engaged partners in an endeavor to obtain results or achieve an outcome that neither investigator could easily accomplish alone. Collaborative research allows teams to investigate more complex questions than a single researcher could investigate, and can extend or transform our current models of humanities research.

Proposals must address or discuss actual research projects that meet or strive for the above characteristics. Projects with tangible research results (such as data, co-authored texts, or digital projects) or that may provide models for best practices in sustainable, collaborative humanities research, including the use of open access or other models of making resources publicly available for use and re-use, are particularly encouraged.

Proposals reflecting a range of types of collaborations are welcome, including but not limited to:

    digital humanities research projects involving librarians, GIS experts, data/metadata specialists, or other technical researchers;
    collaborations between research faculty and field workers, or public outreach or community partners;
    projects that integrate or put into dialogue methods and ideas from the humanities with those from the sciences, social sciences and/or arts;
    collaborations across more than one humanities discipline;

Please send 250-word abstracts to brianlee@ku.edu by March 16, 2015.

Decolonizing Libraries (extended abstract)
01 Feb 2015

    [During the Fall 2014 term I participated in the Hall Center for the Humanities Faculty Colloquium on the theme of Decolonizing Knowledge.This was a fantastic interdisciplinary program that, for me, was a chance to become more familiar with a wide range of writing and ideas, within librarianship and beyond, about notions of decolonization, inclusion, neutrality, and the production of knowledge. I would like to thank colloquium co-directors Byron Caminero-Santangelo and Glenn Adams for organizing it (and inviting me to participate), along with all the other colloquium participants. A publication from the colloquium should be available soon.

    Below is the extended abstract (for a paper in development) that I contributed to the colloquium. This was largely a chance for me to begin to review some of the literature and dip into the work of several librarians who have been deeply engaged in these issues for far longer than me. Particularly inspiring in the library world were the work of nina de jesus, Chris Bourg, Barbara Fister and Trevor Muñoz. Among my next steps: continue to organize and read through an extensive and growing reading list, which I will also share here once I get it in shape.]

This paper will explore the notion of decolonizing libraries by looking at how libraries are complicit in supporting constructions of knowledge that perpetuate existing power structures, and how at the same time they may have the potential to serve as sites of resistance and change. Libraries are revered in the public imagination as symbols of democracy, access to knowledge, and an educated citizenry (De Botton 2012; Maxwell 2006; Smith 2014). But libraries (along with other cultural institutions such as archives and museums, collectively referred to as LAMs) are embedded in larger social-historical contexts, inherit their values from those larger structures, and are constrained by them, so much so that, as nina de jesus argues, “they come to embody institutional oppression, rather than resist it” (de jesus 2014). In addition, because they are built upon professional and organizational values of service and technical efficiency, libraries provide “affordances for ignorance” through technologies that can “magically” facilitate information discovery for the user but that can obscure the modes of production—-and the material, economic, and political forces that control them-—behind the shiny and smooth curtain of the search interface. Digital technologies promise new models of unprecedented access and sharing but these too may inherit or reproduce the same biases, inequalities and power structures.

Libraries, however, also hold a potential for resistance and change that can be realized through individual activism; through deliberate attention to core practices and issues such as collection development, public programming, discovery and access, long-term preservation; and through critical engagement and action within the larger context of research and teaching.

This paper will describe several areas that can serve as openings or entry points to thinking about the project of decolonizing libraries. These entry points, briefly touched upon and noted by the numbers in the sections below, can serve as starting points for further exploration and discussion.
I. A Wolf in LAMs clothing: libraries, archives and museums as producers of colonizing knowledge

Part one of the paper will review some of the literature exploring the colonial and hegemonic aspects of library practices, including (1) how our conception of modern libraries, archives, museums arose out of and reflect the values of the Enlightenment, particularly its colonial legacy. In fact LAMs were at the heart of the colonial enterprise. At home they were the privileged repositories for the artifacts collected and knowledge generated by the colonial powers; in the colonial context they were used as a civilizing influence — a tool to promote literacy, religion, morals, and self-improvement (Bivens-Tatum 2012; Dudley 2013; Edwards 2005). This legacy is evident in (2) cataloging and classification schemes, which reveal racist, sexist and Euro-centric origins and which mask other ways of viewing the world and the voices of the colonized or powerless. Cataloging is a method of knowledge control, and in the pre-digital age, subject terms were a primary mechanism by which library users discovered material. Much work to raise awareness of the problematic nature of library subject terms–and of classification schemes in general– has been undertaken by Sanford Berman, Hope Olson and other activist librarians. (Berman 1971; Olson 2002; Drabinsky 2008; Knowlton 2009). In the digital age, metadata, search and indexing technologies have provided a way around some of the limitations of subject headings, but they have inherited their own set of prejudices and antipathies, sometimes right down to how the code is created, and are often more effective at obscuring them from users behind the “magic” of the search interface (McPherson 2012; Presner 2014; Underwood 2014; Bourg 2015).

The profession of librarianship itself has been critiqued for its (3) political naiveté and failure to confront important social questions. This failure is attributed to the profession’s middle-class aspirations and values, and its preoccupation with a managerial outlook that promotes links with the corporate world and prioritizes service delivery and technical efficiency at the expense of class and social theory, which is largely absent from the LIS curriculum (Pawley 1998). Librarians’ much-embraced concept of (4) information literacy (promoted through instruction and reference programs) may also reinforce hegemonic structures of power. For example, the contemporary models of information literacy have been critiqued for their reliance on market terminology, and for framing information literacy as a set of discrete, individual, marketable skill sets and measurable outcomes. Such approaches reinforce existing models of expertise and authority, condition users to view information as belonging to private, gated and often subscription-based collections, and continue to serve as an affordance of ignorance, obscuring the power relations that determine what kind of knowledge gets created, how we find it, and who gets access. Not incidental to these issues, libraries are notably non-diverse workplaces: 88% of credentialed librarians are white, and there are only 185 (0.1%) credentialed Native American librarians (Beatty 2014; Bourg 2014a; Bourg 2014b; Searle 2013).

Similar issues are also at play in discussions about (5) collection development, particularly in the debate between purchase on demand and curated models of collection building. While the strategy of purchasing what will satisfy the immediate needs of current researchers may seem rational in a time of tight budgets, it also raises concerns about the integrity of collections in the future. Will we be generating significant gaps in our collections, or creating new archival silences by ignoring the material that is currently not in immediate demand? These issues force us to ask ourselves what our professional role is and what communities are we serving (Bourg 2014; Fister 2010).
II. Open Access, publishing and digital humanities: library practice in the digital age

The second part of the paper will explore several specific forward-looking issues or trends relevant to library practice in the digital age. These issues may offer some paths toward decolonization but also present have limitations and constraints of their own.

Open access (6) is a powerful and much-needed intervention that can help increase access to scholarship and break apart librarianship’s close and often exploitative relationship with for-profit commercial publishers and vendors. Yet the main goal of OA is not decolonization, and a one-size-fits-all approach to OA may in some respects work against efforts to decolonize scholarly communication. OA focuses largely on issues of access, reuse rights, metrics and research impact, but does little to address, for example, the technical and logistical problems of getting educational materials to communities lacking adequate Internet access (an issue tacked by initiatives such as WiderNet , or the development of publishing infrastructures that can support the production and management of scholarly research in the developing world. Such infrastructures would allow research communities to attain control of their own research output and encourage greater internal and region-to-region research communication, rather than increasing dependency on the infrastructures—and interests—of the global north and supporting a largely north-to-south research flow. Efforts to make cultural materials “open” can also be at odds with the interests of indigenous or marginalized groups, opening up their heritage for appropriation and profit by those with access to the means of knowledge production. Traditional Knowledge (TK) licenses are one attempt to address some of the inadequacies of Creative Commons licenses in this regard (Christen 2012; Greenberg 2014; Mann 2012).

Another significant development is (7) the emergence of massive digital collections like Hathi Trust, Jstor, Internet Archive, Google Books, Europeana and DPLA, and their increasingly central role in information discovery and as providers of research data. What economic and institutional forces are driving these initiatives, and how well do these kinds of collections enable or limit alternative voices or ways of knowing? For example, in HathiTrust, according to one study, less than 5% of the content is in the Spanish language (Weiss 2014). The issue of “archival silences” comes to the fore in looking at the state of (8) digital recovery projects. Many individual recovery projects originating in the early days of the web have fallen by the wayside due to lack of institutional support and other reasons, resulting in a canon of digital literature far less diverse than envisioned in the early days of the Web (Earhart 2012; Carter 2006). Efforts at studying historical literature by black authors raise questions about how our default digital textual research methods may not only hinder the study of literary history from a racial perspective, but also serve to make invisible many black authors and the unique qualities of their writing, often intended for a localized audience in place and time. But there are also some interesting initiatives that point to ways digital methods might work to uncover and fill in existing gaps. For example, Invisible Australians rearranges the bureaucratically organized collections of the National Archives to reveal the individuals controlled—and extensively documented—under the racist White Australia Policy, and the “Collective Biographies of Women” project provides new digital tools and metadata structures for studying the lives of historical women.

Issues of infrastructure, material production, and political-economic control (9) provide another lens for looking at issues of decolonization. Our seemingly “virtual” information infrastructure is dependent upon real power plants, data centers, a network of satellites orbiting the planet and cables on the ocean floor, and generates landfills of toxic e-waste shipped out of site and out of mind, but with real environmental and human consequences (Mattern 2014, 2016; Munoz 2014). What implications does this have for how we think about and practice information sharing and distribution? What does it mean to decolonize knowledge in an age in which the infrastructure for the production and distribution of information is controlled by a network of little understood corporate and governmental entities? How does our use of free and convenient tools both facilitate new networks of communication, yet feed into the corporate power structures that provide those tools?

Finally, other tools and methods of the digital humanities (10) offer paths to decolonizing knowledge and scholarly practice. Often libraries’ engagement with digital humanities mirrors the approach to information literacy, viewing digital humanities in terms of skill building, job preparation, and marketability. In part libraries are pushed to couch initiatives in these terms in order to justify their value and provide measurable outcomes. But digital humanities also offers opportunities to critically engage with questions of scholarly and pedagogical method, new models of publishing, digital media formats, and other alternative or emerging scholarly practices (Baer 2013). There are many active digital humanities communities engaged with precisely such issues, including #pocodh, which looks at digital humanities through the lens of postcolonial theory and practice, and Global Outlook::Digital Humanities, which promotes communication and collaboration among researchers and students in high, middle and low income economies. The emergence of peer-to-peer and other alternative networks of curating and sharing, the rise of “critical making” and related methodologies point to decentralized, non-textual modes of knowledge production. “Minimal computing” looks at how computing can be done under significant constraints of hardware, software, bandwidth or other factors, through the use of open, sustainable, interoperable, low-cost practices.

These areas all represent opportunities for critical engagement on the part of libraries. Situated at the nexus of a range of communities, systems and issues central to scholarly communication, libraries can promote change through education, advocacy and engagement, working to make more visible the larger systems of knowledge production and access, and encouraging critical thinking about how those systems affect what we can access and discover.
