## [The Institute for Digital Research in the Humanities (IDRH)](http://idrh.ku.edu)

The IDRH was established in 2010 to provide resources and training in the practices and tools of the digital humanities, and to facilitate interdisciplinary academic collaborations and externally funded research. I have co-led the IDRH since it's founding, working with a [stellar cast](https://idrh.ku.edu/people) of co-directors, postdocs, students, and librarian and faculty colleagues across KU and beyond. (See a [brief history of the IDRH here](https://idrh.ku.edu/history).) 

In addition to providing consultations and guidance on DH projects, and to offering workshops, classroom sessions, we have several significant initiatives, some of which are listed below.
