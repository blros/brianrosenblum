  blurb: The Scholarly Publishing Office (SPO, now branded as <a href='http://www.publishing.umich.edu'>Michigan Publishing</a>) was a unit of the University of Michigan Library devoted to developing innovative and economically sustainable publishing and distribution models for scholarly discourse, one of the earliest library-based publishing initatives. I served as Electronic Publishing Librarian at the SPO from it's founding until I left Michigan in 2005. In this role I supported numerous publishing projects, small scale and large scale. Our team published over a dozen journals and scholarly digital projects, provided hosting for non-profit academic organizations' subscription products, and developed a suite of services and that helped establish and sustain scholarly publications and expand the possibilities for library-based publishing.<br /><br />A selection of some of my favorite SPO projects are listed below.
