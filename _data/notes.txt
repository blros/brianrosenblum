I am the Digital Scholarship Librarian/Co-Director, Institute for Digital Research in the Humanities Librarian at the University of Kansas, and Founding Co-Director of KU's Institute for Digital Research in the Humanities (IDRH). With the IDRH Co-Director I provide leadership and coordination for educational, research, and outreach programming for initiative emanating from the IDRH and it's KU Libraries, Hall Center, and CLAS constituencies. I participate in campus-wide discussion regarding building DH teaching and research capacity at KU. I provide expert consultation, support and training on digital scholarship tools, methods and issues via email, one-on-one consultations, classroom visits, and workshop sessions. Participate in, and assist researchers in, planning effective, innovative, and sustainable digital projects. 


I collaborate with faculty, students, librarians and technology staff in digital scholarship-related projects and initiatives that support teaching, learning, and research. 

I am also active in professional organizations in the field including the American Library Association, the Modern Language Association, and the Alliance of Digital Humanities Organizations.

My research interests include sustainable models for scholarly communication and digital humanities production, shadow libraries and equitable access to knowledge from a global perspective, public digital humanities, and minimal computing and sustainable modes of digital scholarly knowledge production.

I see my role as a librarian as a convener, fostering connections and collaborations, connecting people with resources and with each other, mentoring, and opening opportunities and channels of communication for faculty, students, and librarians, and the wider community. From a perch with a wide, cross-disciplinary reach across the higher education landscape.

I am a Librarian at the University of Kansas Libraries (http://lib.ku.edu) where I currently serve as co-director of KU’s Institute for Digital Research in the Humanities (http://idrh.ku.edu). I have administrative, production and outreach responsibilities in support of a variety of digital initiatives and publishing services. Prior to joining KU Libraries’ digital initiatives program in 2005 I worked at the Scholarly Publishing Office at the University Library, University of Michigan (now Michigan Publishing: http://www.publishing.umich.edu/) where I helped develop electronic journals and digital scholarly projects.
