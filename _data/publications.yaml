  abstract: This paper first describes IDRH’s programs and the role of the Stakeholders and co-directors in the partnership, and discusses some of the benefits and challenges of this collaborative model of support and leadership. We then discuss some of the specific ways in which IDRH has tried to build partnership on campus and establish relationships between faculty and the libraries, including the formation of an advisory board, and providing multiple opportunities for faculty to get involved in review committees or as instructors in workshops. This chapter also serves as a critical review of IDRH’s first four years, from the founding of the Institute in fall 2010 to fall 2014, when this chapter was written. <http://docs.lib.purdue.edu/purduepress_ebooks/33/>

  abstract: The purpose of this paper is to describe the history of KU ScholarWorks, the University of Kansas’ institutional repository, and the various strategies used to promote and populate it. This paper describes how KU ScholarWorks came into being, and discusses the variety of activities employed to publicize the repository and encourage faculty to deposit their work. In addition, the paper discusses some of the concerns expressed by faculty members, and some of the obstacles encountered in getting them to use the repository. The paper concludes with some observations about KU’s efforts, an assessment of the success of the program to date, and suggests some next steps the program may take. KU ScholarWorks has relied on a “self-archiving” model, which requires regular communication with faculty and long-term community building. Repository content continues to grow at a steady pace, but uptake among faculty has been slow. In the absence of mandates requiring faculty to deposit work, organizations running institutional repositories must continue to aggressively pursue a variety of strategies to promote repositories to faculty and encourage them to deposit their scholarship. Originality/value – KU’s experience will help other institutions develop institutional repositories by providing examples of marketing strategies, and by promoting a greater understanding of faculty behavior and concerns with regard to institutional repositories.

  abstract: "This article looks at selected digital library projects in the Czech Republic, with a focus on two main domains of activity: digital preservation of cultural heritage, and providing digital access to scholarship through institutional repositories. With regard to digitization of national cultural heritage, the Czech Republic, largely through the leadership of the National Library, has established itself as one of the most active countries in the region. With regard to providing access to Czech research and scholarship, although there is quite a bit of interest among research institutions and universities, institutional repositories are currently in the exploratory stage and have not yet been widely implemented. Copyright laws are repeatedly cited by Czech librarians as one obstacle to improving access to digital resources in both spheres of activity."

  abstract: "Driven by concerns about the current scholarly communication environment, academic libraries are assuming increasingly active roles in the scholarly publishing arena by building new tools and services to support the publication of scholarly content. The University of Kansas (KU) Digital Initiatives program has been exploring ways in which the Libraries and IT can support electronic publishing on campus, gathering information about the scope of publishing activity occurring at KU, engaging faculty editors about scholarly communication issues, and identifying potential campus partners interested in electronic publishing. This presentation will discuss some of the program’s activities to date, and will follow the development of an initial project, the digitization and publication of the back issues of a scholarly journal."

  abstract: "This study was conducted with the cooperation of eIFL.net, the University of Kansas Libraries, the DRIVER project and Key Perspectives Ltd. The aim was to create an inventory of current digital repository activities in developing and transition countries at both the infrastructure and services level. This is the first attempt to collect such data about digital repository activity in developing and transition countries and we hope this will serve as a useful resource for promoting open access and repository development in these regions. This report was produced in the framework of the eIFL-OA advocacy program supported by Open Society Institute and the Wellcome Trust. Over the course of six months, 49 repositories from 20 countries on three continents participated in this survey. The following countries are represented: Argentina, Azerbaijan, Brazil, Cameroon, China, Ghana, Hong Kong, India, Jamaica, Kyrgyzstan, Mongolia, Namibia, Poland, Russia, Slovenia, South Africa, Taiwan, Ukraine, Venezuela, Zimbabwe."

  abstract: "A level playing field is key for global participation in science and scholarship, particularly with regard to how scientific publications are financed and subsequently accessed. However, there are potential pitfalls of the so-called “Gold” open-access (OA) route, in which author-paid publication charges cover the costs of production and publication. Gold OA plans in which author charges are required may not solve the access problem, but rather may shift the access barrier from reader to writer. Under such plans, everyone may be free to read papers, but it may still be prohibitively expensive to publish them. In a scholarly community that is increasingly global, spread over more and more regions and countries of the world, these publication access barriers may be quite significant. // In the present paper, a global suite of colleagues in academe joins this debate. The group of colleagues, a network of researchers active in scholarly publishing, spans four continents and multiple disciplines in the natural sciences, humanities, and social sciences, as well as diverse political and economic situations. We believe that this global sampling of researchers can provide the nuance and perspective necessary to grasp this complex problem. The group was assembled without an attempt to achieve global coverage through random sampling. // This contribution differs from other approaches to the open-access problem in several fundamental ways. (A) It is scholar-driven, and thus can represent the ‘other side of the coin’ of scholarly communication. (B) It focuses on narrative report, where scholars were free to orient their responses as they saw fit, rather than being confined to binary or scalar choices. Finally, and perhaps most importantly, (C) it distinguishes among institutions and countries and situations, highlighting inequalities of access among wealthy and economically-challenged nations, and also within countries depending on the size and location of particular institutions."
